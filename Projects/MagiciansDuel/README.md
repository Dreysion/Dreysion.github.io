# Magicians'Duel

A card game in which you and your friends develop as magicians and compete in a dueling tournament.

This is my first attempt at using a websocket to create a multiplayer game. The project is here, but even when it's finished it won't be able to run on Github pages directly. I'll have it hosted on Itch.io instead.

Art by AI

I'll have more about the game here after I've developed it a bit.
