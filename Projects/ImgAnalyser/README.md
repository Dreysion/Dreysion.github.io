#Img Analyser

THIS PROJECT IS NOT YET FINISHED

The Img Analyser is meant to get the pixels of an image and convert them between hexidecimal and binary systems to look for hidden messages. When this project is finished, you should be able to upload any image and analyse it--furthermore, you should be able to insert your own hidden message into an image you upload, then redownload it with the message.
